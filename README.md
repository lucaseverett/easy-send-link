# Easy Send Link (Chrome Extension)

A simple Chrome extension that allows you to quickly send a link to the current page via email using your default mailto handler.

Unique Features:

- Native-looking toolbar icon: Uses a Google Fonts icon that matches Chrome's default icons, making the extension look like a native part of the browser.
- Dynamic icon update via options page: If you change your system theme, simply open the extension's options page and the icon color will update to match your new theme.
- Multi-extension theme sync: If you have other "Easy" extensions (like Easy Open History or Easy Open Bookmarks), opening the options page in any one of them will update the icon colors for all installed "Easy" extensions at the same time.
- Temporary workaround: This options page method is a temporary solution until Chrome natively supports light/dark icons for extensions in a future update.

Enjoy a seamless, native-feeling experience with "Easy" extensions!
