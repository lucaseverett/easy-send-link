# Easy Send Link (Chrome Extension)

Easy Send Link is a simple Chrome extension that lets you quickly send the current page link via email using your default mail app.

Features:

- Native-looking toolbar icon: Uses a Google Fonts icon that matches Chrome's default icons, so it blends seamlessly with the browser.
- Dark/light mode support: Click any "Easy" extension icon (such as Easy Send Link, Easy Open History, or Easy Open Bookmarks) to instantly update the icon color for all installed "Easy" extensions to match your current system theme.

Enjoy a seamless, native-feeling experience with Easy extensions!
